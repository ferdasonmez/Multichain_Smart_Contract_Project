Sure, I can help you with a simple and compact frontend design for your project. Here's an example of how you could structure it:

Home page
Shows a list of communities
Has a button to create a new community
Community page
Shows information about the community, including its name and list of members
Has a button to create a new proposal
Proposal page
Allows a user to create a new proposal for the community
Includes a description of the proposal and a voting period
Vote page
Shows a list of open proposals for the community
Allows a user to vote on a proposal
